# Jamboree's Graduate Admissions Predictor

## Objective
Jamboree introduces a website feature enabling students to gauge Ivy League admission chances from an Indian perspective. Leveraging data analytics, the analysis deciphers pivotal factors shaping graduate admissions, aiming to empower students with holistic insights.

## Steps:

1. **Importing Required Libraries:** Import necessary libraries for data analysis.
2. **Viewing the Dataset:** Load the dataset and drop irrelevant columns.
3. **Understanding the Data:** Check data types, info, describe, and null values.
4. **Univariate Analysis:** Analyze distribution of individual features.
5. **Bivariate Analysis:** Explore relationships between features.
6. **Correlation Among Variables:** Visualize correlations among features.
7. **Prediction using Regression Models:**
    - Linear Regression using Stats Models
    - Linear Regression using Scikit-learn
    - Lasso and Ridge Regression Models
    - Hyperparameter Tuning
    - Model Comparison and Evaluation
    - Residual Analysis

## Conclusion
After performing analysis and prediction using various regression models, we observed that the Ridge regression model yielded the highest R-squared score of approximately 82% on the testing dataset. However, further analysis revealed that the residuals did not follow a normal distribution, indicating potential model limitations. Further optimization and exploration are recommended to improve model performance.
